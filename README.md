# cal_trend_disparity
This directory contains analytical codes for the project studying temporal trends of associations between fine particulate matter and acute care utilization in California. This is a collaborative project between Anais Teyton and Chen Chen and the manuscript is published [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969724066993). Please contact Chen Chen (chc048@ucsd.edu) for any questions.  

The mock dataset could be downloaded [here](https://zenodo.org/records/13344327) and put in the "data" folder so that the analytical codes could run. To note, the health data in the mock dataset is simulated thus no meaningful association is expected and convergence failures are expected in subgroup analyses for some zctas.
